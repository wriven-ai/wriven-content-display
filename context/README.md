# Wriven Display — Frontend Integration Guide

This folder is a **complete, self-contained guide** for building a frontend that
displays content managed by **Wriven** (an AI-native headless CMS). It is written
for an AI coding agent (or a developer) that will create a **React + Vite** project
that fetches and renders public Wriven content — **products, blog posts, team
members**, etc.

> **You do not need access to the Wriven source code to use this guide.** Everything
> required to build the display app is documented here. Read these files in order.

## What you are building

A **public, read-only website** (no login, no auth UI, no complexity) that pulls
**published** content from a Wriven project over HTTP and renders it. Think of it
like a storefront, a blog, or a marketing site whose content is authored in the
Wriven dashboard and served by the Wriven **Delivery API**.

Examples of what the site might contain:

- **Products** — catalog + detail pages
- **Blog posts** — article list + full article rendering (rich text + images)
- **Team members** — staff/author profiles
- **Categories / tags** — taxonomy used to filter the above

> **Status of this repo (updated 2026-08-14):** the scaffold is done and the app is a
> **static landing site** — real layout (`src/components/layout/`), home sections
> (`src/components/home/`), 404 page, Tailwind v4, shadcn/radix-ui, react-router-dom v7,
> `@` alias wired. **Not done yet:** no `src/lib/wriven.ts`, no `@wriven-ai/*` SDK
> installed, no `VITE_WRIVEN_*` env vars, no content pages. Files 05–07 below cover
> exactly those missing pieces. **This repo uses pnpm** — run `pnpm add` / `pnpm dev`
> instead of the `npm` equivalents shown in generic examples.

## How Wriven works (30-second version)

1. Content is authored in the **Wriven dashboard** (a separate hosted app).
2. Each **project** exposes a **read-only Delivery API**.
3. You authenticate with a **project-scoped API key** (`wrk_live_…`).
4. Your frontend calls `GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/content/{apiId}` and renders
   the JSON. That's it. **Nothing of Wriven runs inside your app** — just `fetch`.

A `read` key returns **published content only** and is **safe to expose in a
browser bundle** (exactly like Contentful/Sanity delivery tokens). See
[02-getting-credentials.md](./02-getting-credentials.md) for the security model.

## Install the Wriven SDK

Wriven ships an official SDK, **published on npm** (`0.1.0`):

```bash
pnpm add @wriven-ai/client        # core delivery client (typed, isomorphic, zero-dep)
pnpm add @wriven-ai/react         # optional: <WrivenRichText> renderer
```

```ts
import { createClient } from '@wriven-ai/client';
const wriven = createClient({
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_WRIVEN_PROJECT_ID,
  token: import.meta.env.VITE_WRIVEN_TOKEN, // wrk_live_…
});
const posts = await wriven.getEntries('blog_post', { sort: '-publishedAt', limit: 10 });
```

Prefer the SDK. If you'd rather skip the dependency, [05-client-setup.md](./05-client-setup.md)
also includes a tiny typed `fetch` helper (~50 lines, zero-dep) with the identical
API — useful as a no-install fallback or to understand what the SDK does under the hood.

## Quickstart (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Scaffold — ALREADY DONE in this repo (uses pnpm, not npm)
pnpm create vite@latest wriven-display -- --template react-ts
cd wriven-display && pnpm install
pnpm add react-router-dom

# 2. Env — fill these in from the Wriven dashboard (see 02-getting-credentials.md)
cat > .env.local <<'EOF'
VITE_WRIVEN_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_WRIVEN_PROJECT_ID=<your project id>
VITE_WRIVEN_TOKEN=<wrk_live_... read key>
EOF

# 3. Drop in the client from 05-client-setup.md -> src/lib/wriven.ts

# 4. Fetch published entries of a content type
const posts = await wriven.list('blog_post', { sort: '-publishedAt', limit: 10 });

# 5. Run
pnpm dev
```

Then read [08-vite-build-guide.md](./08-vite-build-guide.md) for the full build.

## Conventions used in this guide

- All code is **TypeScript + React + Vite**.
- HTTP examples use the global `fetch` (works in browser, Node 18+, edge).
- Every Delivery API response is wrapped in `{ success, data }` / `{ success, error }`.
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings (or `null`).
- Field names like `blog_post`, `publishedAt`, `wrk_live_…` are literal — match them exactly.
